Note: This is readme for optionaltry folder. It is not part of main evaluation features.
Here I was trying out displaying the optional glass sphere so the rightmost sphere shows some features of glass in that file. So for the additional part, you can look at that file. Rest of the code is similar to main but it doesnt have the glossy sphere with reflective surface. Instead I have tried getting glass like surface. 

For main evaluation, refer to main.cpp outside this folder.

For running file for optinal part,

Compile:
g++ -std=c++11 try.cpp -lGL -lglut -lGLU

Execute:
./a.out
